    <h2>List of Stuff We Talked About</h2>
    <div class="tuck">
        <ul>
            <li>If you are going to be including php in your project, it must be in a file ending in
            .php. This type of file cannot be viewed by opening the file in your browser. It can only be viewed on a server.
          To set up your php dev environment, create an index.php file in the root directory of your project. While you are in the root directory,
        run this command: php -S localhost:8000.</li>
            <li>In order to reference information from other php files in your project, you must reference the file like so: include(filename);
            This include will only work for whatever php is below it in the file, so make sure it is above whatever code depends on it.</li>
            <li>Connecting to a database</li>
            <ul>
                <li>pg_connect("Database credentials go here");</li>
                <li>pg_query("database query goes here");</li>
                <li>pg_fetch_assoc(database info you are fetching goes here)</li>
            </ul>

            <li>php is rendered first before anything else in the browser. Php code will not be recognized
            unless it is contained in a <?php ?> tag.</li>
            <li>The shorthand for including the content of a php variable in your html, is by putting
            said variable in a <?= ?> tag.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
