    <p>
      Hello, My name is Kendra Jordan. I graduated from Kentucky State University
with a Major in Pure Mathematics. I wanted to join a coding bootcamp because I had some
experience with programming with C++ when I was in college and would like to have
a career where I can apply my critical thinking skills. I would like to change jobs from
being a customer service representative for the Department
of Medicaid Services to being a web developer.</p>
